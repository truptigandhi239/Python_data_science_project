# Python_data_science_project
I bring to the table a blend of problem solving, decision making and technical skills. Highly accomplished with crafting algorithms using pythons and making use of machine learning to make sense of data, and then using data visualization to present the data to decision makers.

Software and Analysis skills includes: 
- Data modeling
- Big Data Analysis
- Visualization
- Statistical Data Analysis
- Supervised and Unsupervised Machine Learning Algorithms
